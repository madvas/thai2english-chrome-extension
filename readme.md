# Thai2English Chrome Extension

### Chrome extension which uses thai2english.com to translate Thai to English

This extension was made via [Clojurescript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript) and [Chromex](https://github.com/binaryage/chromex)

This extension is not officially made by [thai2english.com](http://www.thai2english.com/) and I am not anyhow related with the website.
